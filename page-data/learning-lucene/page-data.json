As an engineer, my thoughts on these kinds of occurrences can pretty much be summarized as: abstractions are great simplifications, but man can they generate deja vu if you dig too deep! So to clear up a few things, I headed over to db-engines.com to use their great, high-level comparison tool to visualize the stats on Solr v. ElasticSearch v. MongoDB, the final being a third contender for certain subsets of text-based search functionality, although it isn't really in the same class as the former two. Take a look at their <a href=\"https://db-engines.com/en/system/Elasticsearch%3BMongoDB%3BSolr\">comparison table</a> for yourself.\n<br><br>\nSome quick things I noted:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>ElasticSearch, released four years later, is quite a bit more popular today than Solr, according to the <a href=\"https://db-engines.com/en/ranking\">db-engines.com ranking</a>.</li>\n<li>Since both ElasticSearch and Solr are based on Lucene, they offer much of the same <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/tree/master/lucene/queryparser/src/java/org/apache/lucene/queryparser\">queryparser functionality</a>, including <a href=\"https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_6/the-dismax-query-parser.html#the-dismax-query-parser\">dismax</a>, as well as features like dynamic field mapping</li>\n<li>Although Lucene also offers some <a href=\"https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_5/machine-learning.html\">machine learning functionality</a>, anomaly detection along with some other robust <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/7.10/ml-overview.html\">machine learning features</a> seem to give ElasticSearch an edge in some cases (see also <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/kibana\">Kibana</a>)</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Additional Resources and Readings:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/elasticsearch-intro.html\">https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/elasticsearch-intro.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-main-differences-between-ElasticSearch-and-NoSQL-DBs-like-MongoDB-Do-you-think-these-two-technologies-products-would-have-more-similarities-than-differences-in-the-near-future\">https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-main-differences-between-ElasticSearch-and-NoSQL-DBs-like-MongoDB-Do-you-think-these-two-technologies-products-would-have-more-similarities-than-differences-in-the-near-future</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/8_7/overview-of-searching-in-solr.html\">https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/8_7/overview-of-searching-in-solr.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/regex/\">https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/regex/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Starting to Learn Lucene: An Engineer's Search","date":"11 December, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/learning-lucene/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
