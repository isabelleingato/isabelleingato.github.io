And why not use the opportunity to also learn another language like Go with the right concurrency primitives? After <a href=\"https://github.com/isabelleingato/go-practice\">following all the golang tutorials</a>, I dove into the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly#getting-started\">docs</a> for compiling Go to WebAssembly to make it executable in a browser environment.
