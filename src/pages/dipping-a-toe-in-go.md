Since attending Aaron Turner's [presentation](https://perfmattersconf.com/talks/#aaron) at the 2020 [PerfMatters Conference](https://perfmattersconf.com/), I'd been wanting to try WebAssembly. And why not use the opportunity to also learn another language like Go with the right concurrency primitives? After [following all the golang tutorials](https://github.com/isabelleingato/go-practice), I dove into the [docs](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly#getting-started) for compiling Go to WebAssembly to make it executable in a browser environment. This is the [result](https://github.com/isabelleingato/go-practice/tree/master/webassembly) so far, but I'm hoping to add more functionality in the coming months.
